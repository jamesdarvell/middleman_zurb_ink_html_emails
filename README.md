Zurb Ink Based Middleman Project
================================

This is a template middleman project for developing html emails. 

Middleman is a static website generator built using the Ruby programming language. [You can read about it here.](http://middlemanapp.com)

The big benefit of this is that you can use a lot of cool tools from the Ruby on Rails world to produce your static web sites. Amongst these precious goodies is HAML, a simple way of specifying html that is easier to read and understand.

Zurb Ink is a css framework designed specifically for the task of building responsive HTML emails. It encapsulates a highly tested approach to building html emails that work on all clients and devices.

One of the problems with working with html emails is that the html markup quickly becomes very difficult to understand and modify.

If you have done much web development in the days before comprehensive css support, when all but the most simple page layouts were achieved with tables and invisible images, you know what I am talking about.

HTML emails are like that, but worse...

In this project, I will be using Middleman together with HAML, some customisations of my own, and the Zurb ink framework. The goal is to really simplify the task of hand coding html emails, so that you only need to write and maintain a small quantity of easy to understand source code. This will then be automatically shredded and mangled into the disgusting mess that email clients find palletable.

It includes custom helpers and a middleman extension to make it easy to layout a html email using the Zurb Ink framework.

Somewhere along the line, this project will probably acquire a cool name. If you want to suggest one, feel free.
